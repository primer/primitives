# Primitives v8

## Overview

Primitives v8 introduces an entirerly new set of color, size, spacing and typography tokens. Below is a detailed explanation for each change.

- [Token naming convention](#token-naming-convention)
- [New color token names](#new-color-token-names)
- [Token build process](#token-build-process)
- [Theme CSS exports](#theme-css-exports)
- [Size, space and typography tokens](#size-space-and-typography-tokens)

## Token naming convention

The updated naming convention aims to improve usability for designers and developers. By including a `property` in each token, its clear when and where a token is intended to be used. Additionally, by introducing `variant` and `scale` it becomes easier to add new options for a token, or add a totally new set of tokens with consistent naming.

The design token naming convention is based on three categories: **base, component/pattern, functional**. Each category is a subset of the over-arching convention.

`prefix-namespace-pattern-variant*-property-variant*-scale`

\*variant scope changes based on the category

### Base

Base tokens represent global, constant values. These are the lowest level tokens and map directly to a raw value.

[prefix]-[namespace*]-[property*]-[variant]-[scale]

```
brand-base-color-lime-5
base-size-4
base-color-green-5
base-fontWeight-semibold
```

### Functional

Functional tokens reference base tokens and represent more specific use cases.

[prefix]-[property*]-[variant]-[scale]

```
bgColor-inset
borderColor-default
brand-borderWidth-thin
boxShadow-inset-thick
```

### Component/pattern

Component/pattern represents component and pattern specific tokens which should only be used in component CSS.

[prefix]-[pattern*]-[variant]-[property*]-[scale]

```
control-danger-bgColor-hover
button-primary-bgColor-rest
brand-control-xsmall-paddingInline-normal
text-codeInline-fontSize
```

## New color token names

Most colors have been renamed to match the new convention. These changes have been documented in the migration tables below.

- Primitives
- Patterns
- Shadows
- No changes (same name, new token)

## Token build process

Tokens have been moved to json files in the `src/tokens](https://github.com/primer/primitives/tree/main/src/tokens) directory. Those tokens are compiled with [style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) in [scripts/buildTokens.ts](https://github.com/primer/primitives/blob/main/scripts/buildTokens.ts).

For implementation and contribution details, see the [Primitives README](https://github.com/primer/primitives/blob/main/README.md)

## Theme CSS exports

Color themes are now exported directly from `/primitives` as individual CSS files. Previously, color themes were configured in Primer CSS. This removes a dependency on Primer CSS.

## Size, space and typography tokens

New sizing and typography tokens! Most of these tokens are set in `rem` units. Primer CSS utility classes related to sizing have been updated to reference these new tokens.
