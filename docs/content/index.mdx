title: Primer Primitives
---

import {HeroLayout} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat'

export default HeroLayout

## Install

```shell
npm install @primer/primitives
```

## Usage

Primitive data is served in several formats from the [`dist/`](https://unpkg.com/browse/@primer/primitives/dist/) folder:

- `dist/scss` contains [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) files that define CSS variables to be imported into other SCSS files
- `dist/json` contains JSON files for each set of primitives
- `dist/js` contains CommonJS-style JavaScript modules for each set of primitives, as well as an index file that loads all of the primitives for all primitive types. The JavaScript modules also include TypeScript typings files for use in TypeScript projects.
