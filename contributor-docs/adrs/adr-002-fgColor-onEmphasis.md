## Context

The `fgColor-onEmphasis` token is using a white color for all color themes apart from `dark high contrast`.

There is no need for this. We assume this was done to have the background colors a little bit more intense, but the actual contrast seems less optimal.
It also presents a lot of complication as the colors have to be inverted for just this seem.

## Decision

In an effort to make maintaining design tokens easier and to make the package more predictable we will make the `fgColor-onEmphasis` white in `dark high contrast` as well, aligning it with all other light and dark themes.

### Impact

Some other tokens need to be adjusted in `dark high contrast` to assure accessible contrasts.
