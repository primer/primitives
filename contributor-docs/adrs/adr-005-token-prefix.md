## Context

Currently primitives have no prefix, which means once converted to css they can be used like `--fgColor-default`. This is very convenient but could lead to naming collisions or confusion if folks use their own css variables e.g. is `--button-fgColor-default` a token coming from primitive or a local variable?

To solve this we could add a prefix like `primer` or `product` to our tokens, resulting in css variables like `--primer-fgColor-default`.

## Decision

The following decisions need ot be made:

1. Do we think that this is a legit problem that is serious enough to invest somewhat significant resources into?
2. If yes, what is an appropriate prefix?
3. If no, do we need some kind of guidance in primer.style, or are we good without it?

### Impact

- We will need to a) keep both prefixed and non-prefixed tokens for quite a while and b) work on removing all non-prefixed tokens from dotCom doing PRs and using stylelint.

### Alternatives

Not using a prefix and keeping it as is.
