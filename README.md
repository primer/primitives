## Install

This repository is distributed on [npm][npm]. After [installing npm][install-npm], you can install `@primer/primitives` with this command.

```sh
npm install --save @primer/primitives
```

## Usage

[Storybook](https://primer.style/primitives/storybook) | [Docs](https://primer.style/foundations/primitives/getting-started)

See [Primitives documentation](https://primer.style/foundations/primitives/getting-started) for more information on theming and using CSS variables.

Data is served from the `dist/` folder:

- `dist/css` contains CSS files with values available as CSS variables

## Design token data

Design token data is stored in the [src/tokens](./src/tokens/) directory. These tokens are compiled with [style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) in [scripts/buildTokens.ts](./scripts/buildTokens.ts).

To make working with tokens easier, we added some additional functionality on top of what style dictionary comes with:

### Extending and Overwriting

We have two main color modes: `light` and `dark`. Additionally we have specific accessibility modes based on those, such as `light high contrast`.

We added a way to create a mode by only including the changes from the main mode. We call this `overrides`.
`Overrides` are cerated in `src/tokens/functional/color/[light|dark]/overrides/` and have to be added to [themes.config.ts](./scripts/themes.config.ts) to work.
In the individual files, e.g. `light.high-contrast.json5` you can now add tokens in the same structure as in any main file, e.g. `primitives-light.json5` to replace them.

### Transforming Colors with Alpha and Mix

#### Alpha

You can create color tokens that inherit a color but have a different alpha value by adding the `alpha` property.
**Note:** The original alpha value will be replaced by your value. If you add `alpha: 0.4` to a color, it doesn't matter if the color you reference has no `alpha` or `alpha: 0.7`, the new token will always have newly the defined value of `alpha: 0.4`.

```json5
{
  muted: {
    $value: '{base.color.blue.3}',
    alpha: 0.4, // the opacity value of the color === 40% opaque
    $type: 'color',
  },
}
```

#### Mix

In rare cases, you may need to create a color between two steps in the color scale, e.g. between `gray.4` and `gray.5`. A common example are interactive states, like `hover` where a full step on the color scale would be to much. For those cases you can use the `mix` property.

The `mix` proeprty mixes the color it gets into the main color from the `$value` attribute. The amount added is controlled by the `weight`. A weight of `0.1` adds 10% of the color, and a weight of `0.75` adds 75%.

A `mix` proprty must always have a `color` and a `weight` child. `color` can be a `hex` value or a reference to a valid color. The `weight` property must receive a value between `0.0` and `1`.

```json5
{
  control: {
    $value: '{base.color.gray.4}', // main color
    $type: 'color',
    mix: {
      color: '{base.color.gray.5}', // color to mix into the main color
      weight: 0.2, // amount of the mix color that is added === 20% of gray.5 is mix into gray.4
    },
  },
}
```

#### Extensions property

According to the [w3c design token specs](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/#design-token), the [`$extensions`](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/#extensions) property is used for additional meta data.

For our Figma export we use the following meta data:

- `collection` the collection that the token is added to within Figma
- `mode` the mode that the token is added to within the collection in Figma
- `scopes` the scopes that are assigned to the token in Figma, the actual Figma compatible `scopes` are retreive from an object in the [figmaAttributes transformer](./src/transformers/figmaAttributes.ts)

Code example

```json5
  bgColor: {
    $value: '{borderColor.accent.muted}',
    $type: 'color',
    $extensions: {
      'org.primer.figma': {
        collection: 'pattern/mode',
        mode: 'light',
        scopes: ['bgColor'],
      },
    },
  }
```

#### Token names and @-hack

Token names have to be in camelCase or kebab-case and may only include letters, numbers and `-`. This is enforced by the token validation (`npm run lint:tokens`).
The only acception is the `@`-hack. This is used when you want to have a default value and sub-values, e.g. `bgColor.accent` and `bgColor.accent.muted`.
In this case you can create the follwing structure. The `@` will be removed from the name and act as the default value.

```json5
{
  bgColor: {
    accent: {
      '@': {
        // values for accent (default)
      },
      muted: {
        // values for accent-muted
      },
    },
  },
}
```
